CCD Semi-Automated Stock Market and Economic Data Collection Program
Version 0.5.0 "Arbitary Version Name here"
Made by Aeioux and Pone

## Description

This is a Project that is done mainly to assist some folks over on
NationStates in order to collect the necessary data in order to allow
the Treasurer to simulate an Economic System for the region.

## Disclaimer
This was mostly made by Pone - man who was just starting out with 
Javascript. So, this is your one and only warning that there will be 
bugs that we simply didn't know of that might break this entire 
program. 

Good luck! 

## Changelog 

0.5.0 - We made a ReadMe.md; Project is 'mostly' finished.

## Modifications

Feel free to modify this limited project which only does three 
things - 'Start': which takes some NS Stats of all nations in the 
Confederation that is disposed into a bunch of .json files; 'Clear 
Cache': which clears cache; and 'Stock': which collects the 
necessary information for a Confederation Treasurer to update the 
stock market and post economic indictators - and even if we have 
plans to update it more, feel free to change it! You definitely can 
make it better than Pone who's just a beginner!
